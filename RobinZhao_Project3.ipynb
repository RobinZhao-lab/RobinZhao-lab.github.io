    "## Introduction\n",
    "The most important reason I chose to explore gender-neutral baby names is that my own English name, Robin, is a gender-neutral name. I adopted this name on 2022. Before that, I went by Eleanor, a traditionally feminine name. My Chinese name, Ruobing, sounds very similar to Robin, and I liked that connection, but I did not choose Robin earlier because I believed it was mostly a boy’s name.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a sociology major in college, I was introduced to ideas about gender, identity, and the social construction of norms. Before that, I held some of the common stereotypes many people have, for example, assuming that names should clearly signal gender, or that gender-neutral names were “mostly for boys.” The more I studied topics like gender roles, labeling, and identity expression, the more I began questioning these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more I studied, the more I realized that choosing a gender-neutral name did not make my identity less clear, instead, it gave me a sense of openness and flexibility that aligned with how I understood myself. Changing my name to Robin in 2022 felt like a meaningful reflection of this shift. It represented both personal growth and a move away from rigid gender expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this experience, I am especially interested in whether more babies today are receiving gender-neutral names in more recently. Examining this trend allows me to connect my personal story with broader cultural changes in how society understands gender and identity."

    "My initial hypothesis was that the use of gender-neutral baby names in NYC would increase over time, especially given broader cultural conversations about gender inclusivity and the rising popularity of unisex identities. However, the results of this analysis do not align with that expectation. Instead of showing a steady upward trend, the total number of babies with gender-neutral names drops sharply after 2014 and remains relatively low through 2021. Even when adjusting for overall birth counts, the proportion of neutral-name babies demonstrates a similar decline. This downward trend also appears consistently in the popularity of individual gender-neutral names.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several possible explanations for this unexpected pattern. First, the dataset ends in 2021, which means we are missing the years 2022–2025, which is a period that public discussions about gender identity, nonbinary recognition, and inclusive naming practices have accelerated significantly. It is possible that the trend shifted upward again after 2021, but the absence of these later years prevents us from capturing that movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the steep decline after 2014 may reflect broader demographic and social changes in NYC, including changes in the composition of the population, migration patterns, and birth rates across different cultural groups—factors that influence naming preferences independently of gender-identity trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, because the dataset reflects NYC only, it may not represent national or global naming patterns. It is possible that gender-neutral naming increased elsewhere but not within NYC specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while this analysis did not confirm my original hypothesis, it offers a useful starting point for understanding how gender-neutral naming patterns may be shaped by cultural, demographic, and data-related factors. The decline observed after 2014 raises important questions rather than definitive answers, and the missing post-2021 data leaves open the possibility that more recent shifts in gender discourse could reveal different trends. With a more complete dataset in future years, we may see a clearer picture, either confirming the patterns observed here or revealing new shifts in gender-neutral naming."
